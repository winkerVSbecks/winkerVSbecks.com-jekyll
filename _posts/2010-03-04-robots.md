This is a prototype installation for exploring simultaneous existence of robots and humans in a physical space. A swarm of robots, with characteristics based on different types of bees in a hive, is left alone to live and occupy a space.

* The queen sits stationary observing the space and sending out commands to the other robots.
* The worker is provided the task to map out the actual space, filtering out interactions with humans.
* The soldier tries to prevent close interactions with the queen.

Made with [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/)
